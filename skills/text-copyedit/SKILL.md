Markdown list-form format

* Use a tree/list structure to organize ideas.
* Group logically related ideas into a tree-block.
  * Use nesting to expand on a point.
* Avoid introducing headings.
  * Use a short paragraph to introduce a tree-block.
* Use minimal formatting.
* Use `-` to introduce points.
* Keep each section focused.

Example:

```
Short text preceding section 1.
